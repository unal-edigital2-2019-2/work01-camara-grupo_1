WARNING:Bitgen:343 - This design contains pins which have locations (LOC) that
   are not user-assigned or I/O Standards (IOSTANDARD) that are not
   user-assigned.  This may cause I/O contention or incompatibility with the
   board power or connectivity affecting performance, signal integrity or in
   extreme cases cause damage to the device or the components to which it is
   connected.  To prevent this warning, it is highly suggested to specify all
   pin locations and I/O standards to avoid potential contention or conflicts
   and allow proper bitstream creation.
This message applies to the following I/O ports:
   D<1>
   D<0>
   CAM_reset
   CAM_pwdn
   Href
   Vsync
   VGA_Vsync_n
   VGA_Hsync_n

INFO:Bitgen:40 - Replacing "Auto" with "NoWait" for option "Match_cycle".  Most
   commonly, bitgen has determined and will use a specific value instead of the
   generic command-line value of "Auto".  Alternately, this message appears if
   the same option is specified multiple times on the command-line.  In this
   case, the option listed last will be used.
